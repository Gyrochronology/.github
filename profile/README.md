# Welcome to Gyrochronology!
## Overview
This GitHub Organization holds all the projects that are a part of the _Gyrochronology_ project at [Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University](https://daytonabeach.erau.edu/), led by [Dr. Terry Oswalt](https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=2b207d2f4b92a919JmltdHM9MTY5NDIxNzYwMCZpZ3VpZD0wMzczMmFlZS0wNGFiLTY3YzMtMmExMC0zOWRjMDUzYjY2MDkmaW5zaWQ9NTIxNw&ptn=3&hsh=3&fclid=03732aee-04ab-67c3-2a10-39dc053b6609&psq=Terry+dean+oswalt++linkedin&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGlua2VkaW4uY29tL2luL3RlcnJ5LW9zd2FsdC0yMTg2MTJhNw&ntb=1) (principal investigator) and [Dr. Derek Buzasi](https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=dfc9fe62ca4b9411JmltdHM9MTY5NDIxNzYwMCZpZ3VpZD0wMzczMmFlZS0wNGFiLTY3YzMtMmExMC0zOWRjMDUzYjY2MDkmaW5zaWQ9NTIyOA&ptn=3&hsh=3&fclid=03732aee-04ab-67c3-2a10-39dc053b6609&psq=derek+buzasi+linkedin&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGlua2VkaW4uY29tL2luL2RlcmVrLWJ1emFzaS1hMWEwMjU1&ntb=1) (co-principle investigator, based in [FGCU](https://www.fgcu.edu/)).

## What is Gyrochronology? 
Gyrochronology is the empirical relation between a star's rotation rate and its age. For stars on the main sequence (MS stars) of spectral type F through M, gyrochronology may be an accurate way to measure stellar ages for stars roughly 0.6 to 1.0 solar masses.


The paradigm, Gyrochronology, which has been calibrated using solar-type stars and white dwarfs in open clusters, can be one of the better tools for determining the ages of the main sequence and white dwarf stars. The main physical theory that surrounds this project is known as Gyrochronology. It is a theory based on determining the age of low-mass, main-sequence (MS) stars. MS stars with low masses are said to be at the beginning of the main part of their lives. A star's time on the main sequence marks their "adult lives" as stars. Pre-main sequence stars are still in the development stages of becoming a star and have not yet reached the criteria for becoming main sequence stars.
